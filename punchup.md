Description

Hello! For my punchup, I plan to add an interactive animation of petals falling in the background of my landing page and then on every page at the footer, there is a pie of petals that can be swiped away with the users mouse.

What is the work you’re taking on?:

The work I am taking on I believe will be very focused on animations and interactions. I believe I will have to do a lot of experimentation and researchon how to implement the falling petals and make sure to know how to keep the footer the same on each page with the same interactive motion.

How do you think this is going to enhance your body of work? Will it be a new entry, or an interesting interaction?:

I believe this is going to enhance my portfolio in a way that it will really showcase who I am as a person. I really love flowers and soft colours like pastel purples, and I have always wanted to implement a sort of flower aesthetic into my portfolio and I really believe the motion of the falling petals will add a lot of interest into my portfolio. Furthermore, I believe that the footers additional interactivity with the "sweeping away the petals" will make my footer more noticeable and will hopefully encourage people to scroll to the bottom of my portfolio :3

Resources:
I will be using help from the resources you have given us so far about animation, I also believe I will use React + Vite as my framework, but am currently unsure.

Any fears, uncertainties, doubts about the implementation:

I currently feel very anxious about the footer and how I can get the mouse to interact with the fallen petals at the footer. I also wonder if I should create the petals through coding or import them as svgs and just animate them from there. A lot of my fears lay in the fear of the unknown, I think I just need to research more!
